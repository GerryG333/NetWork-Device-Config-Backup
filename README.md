# NetWork-Device-Config-Backup
Configure automatic backup scripts for switches of multiple equipment manufacturers in the production network.

At the same time, compare the configuration with yesterday and baseline cconfiguration to ensure these equipment configuration correct. Also this project use logging system to record device configuration backup and configuration comparation result. To providibing code revising basis, programme also record errors happen in code running.
